    "##### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposes a moving vehicle tracking module that uses dynamic and geometric properties of the tracked vehicle and estimates them using single bayes filter per tracked object.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key points\n",
    "\n",
    "Model based tracking : What geometric primitives to use and which scenarios to have there applicability.\n",
    "Dynamic properties: What corresponds to be a dynamic property? Is this the same as descriptor vs feature separation mentioned in the ICP documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common approaches to tracking: data segmentation and association before doing a filter update stage. Commonly vehicle speed and position are tracked. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This paper introduces model based approach which encompasses both geometric and dynamic properties of the tracked vehicle. Concept of anchor point coordinates are introduced to model the same.\n",
    "- An abstract sensor representation called virtual scan is introduced to model the sensor detection and ease the detection in the point cloud.\n"
